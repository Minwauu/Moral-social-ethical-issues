## Moral issues

- Moral issues are those that concern an individual’s sense of right and wrong. For example, 
some people happily download and use paid software without purchasing a licence while
others don’t feel that the practice is morally correct. A person’s morals can be influenced 
by the people around them. For example: friends, family or teachers.

## Ethical issues

- Ethical issues relate to society and its sense of what is right or wrong. Ethical issues 
include the use and misuse of personal data. In general, society believes that personal
data should be stored securely and not used for anything other than the purpose for which
it was collected. 

## Cultural issues

- Cultural issues arise from the differences in moral values between people in different 
geographical areas. In the UK, people are generally happy for photographs containing
them to be taken in public and shared online. In other countries, this would not be seen as 
acceptable. When creating a new computer system, computer scientists must consider
where their system is going to be used and what people’s attitudes towards it would be.

## Legal issues

- Legal issues are those that relate to the law. There are a number of laws in the UK that 
specifically relate to the use of computers and computer systems. Examples of these
include: The Computer Misuse Act 1990, The Data Protection Act 1998, The Freedom of
Information Act 2000 and The General Data Protection Regulation 2016

- Lawmakers face great challenges in the digital age. Enforcing copyright has been made 
increasingly difficult with the growth of the Internet, individuals are difficult to trace online
and international online services have to be made to comply with laws from all of the
countries in which they operate.

## Developments in computer science

- Advances in computer science and other digital technologies have changed the way in 
which society communicates. New technology has brought with it developments in the 
capability to monitor behaviour and to gather, analyse, distribute and publish personal
information, sometimes against the will of society. 


## The role of computer scientists

- The people with the power to improve the usage of computer systems are computer 
scientists and software engineers, but with power comes responsibility. Computer 
scientists must always be aware of the moral and social aspects of their work as well as
their potential to produce systems that assist and support millions of people around the
world.

## Examples for case studies

- In 2017, Channel 4 News started an investigation into Cambridge Analytica’s actions
relating to the 2016 US Presidential Election. Ethical and privacy issues were raised when
personal data was collected from sources including Facebook users without their consent.

- WannaCry, a piece of ransomware, targeted computers running Microsoft Windows in 2017. The ransomware had a significant global impact and affected NHS computer systems in England and Scotland.

## Legislation

### Challenges facing legislators 

- Technology can be used for illegal purposes in unforeseen ways. And because technology changes rapidly the law cannot keep up with these changes.
- Internet is global, so any activity that may be legal in one country may be illegal in another.
- Encryption allows the monitoring of criminal acivity much more difficult.
- Crimes may be committed by states.
- Powerful technology companies lobby for their own interests.

  ### Computer Misuse Act (1990)

  - Anti-hacking legislation
  - Prevent unauthorised access to computer
  - Intentionally impair the operation of computer systems e.g:
    - denial of service (DDOS) on web servers
    - distributing viruses

  - It involves:
    - Spreading viruses
    - Hacking (unauthorised access)
    - Data theft
    - Data destructions
    - Denial-of-service attacks
   
  - Why?:
    - Bored young people seeking the thrill of breaking into big systems
    - Retribution (e.g a disgruntled employee who has been sacked)
    - Political activism (e.g Wikileaks)
    - Stealing data for commercial gain
    - Stealing personal data for blackmail
    - Stealing financial data (e.g banking details)
    - Stealing data for criminal gain.

  - Three levels of offence:
    - Unauthorised access - e.g breaking into a system
    - Unauthorised access with intent to commit an offence - e.g breaking into a system and stealing data
    - Unauthorised modification of data e.g distribution of viruses

  - Special category data is personal data that needs more protection because it is sensitive. They include:
    - personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin
    - personal data revealing political opinions
    - personal data revealing religious or philosophical beliefs
    - personal data revealing trade union membership
    - genetic data
    - biometric data (where used for identification purposes)
    - data concerning health
    - data concerning a person’s sex life
    - data concerning a person’s sexual orientation
   
  ### Data Protection Act

- The purpose of the data protection act is to ensure that data collected about individuals by companies and other organisations are stored securely and used safely, fairly and appropriately.

  - Organisations must conform to the eight principles of the DPA
  - The DPA controls the way personal data are used
  - Personal data are data that allow an individual to be identified (this can be name, biometric data etc.)
  - Gives legal rights to people who have information stored about them.

- Eight principles of the DPA:
  - Personal information must be used fairly and lawfully
  - Personal information must be used only for limited purposes
  - Personal information must be adequate, relevant and not excessive
  - Personal information must be accurate and up to date
  - Personal information must not be kept for longer than is necessary
  - Personal information must be used within the rights of the person
  - Personal information must be kept securely
  - Personal information must not be transferred outside the EU.

- How does the DPA apply to schools:

  Schools hold lost of personal data about pupils:
  - Personal information must be used only for limited purposes - data about pupils can only be used for supporting pupils' education.
  - Personal information must not be kept for longer than is necessary - When a pupil leaves a school data needs to be deleted. Some data however schools can keep such as exam results.
  - Personal information must be accurate and up to date - contact information for parents must be updated regularly in case there is an emergency in school.
  - Personal information must be kept securely - laptops and USB sticks need to be encrypted in case these devices get stolen.
  - Personal information must not be transferred outside the EU - external providers such as cloud services need to be in the EU.
