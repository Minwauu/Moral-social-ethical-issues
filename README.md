## Moral issues

- Moral issues are those that concern an individual’s sense of right and wrong. For example, 
some people happily download and use paid software without purchasing a licence while
others don’t feel that the practice is morally correct. A person’s morals can be influenced 
by the people around them. For example: friends, family or teachers.

## Ethical issues

- Ethical issues relate to society and its sense of what is right or wrong. Ethical issues 
include the use and misuse of personal data. In general, society believes that personal
data should be stored securely and not used for anything other than the purpose for which
it was collected. 

## Cultural issues

- Cultural issues arise from the differences in moral values between people in different 
geographical areas. In the UK, people are generally happy for photographs containing
them to be taken in public and shared online. In other countries, this would not be seen as 
acceptable. When creating a new computer system, computer scientists must consider
where their system is going to be used and what people’s attitudes towards it would be.

## Legal issues

- Legal issues are those that relate to the law. There are a number of laws in the UK that 
specifically relate to the use of computers and computer systems. Examples of these
include: The Computer Misuse Act 1990, The Data Protection Act 1998, The Freedom of
Information Act 2000 and The General Data Protection Regulation 2016

- Lawmakers face great challenges in the digital age. Enforcing copyright has been made 
increasingly difficult with the growth of the Internet, individuals are difficult to trace online
and international online services have to be made to comply with laws from all of the
countries in which they operate.

## Developments in computer science

- Advances in computer science and other digital technologies have changed the way in 
which society communicates. New technology has brought with it developments in the 
capability to monitor behaviour and to gather, analyse, distribute and publish personal
information, sometimes against the will of society. 


## The role of computer scientists

- The people with the power to improve the usage of computer systems are computer 
scientists and software engineers, but with power comes responsibility. Computer 
scientists must always be aware of the moral and social aspects of their work as well as
their potential to produce systems that assist and support millions of people around the
world.

## Examples for case studies

- In 2017, Channel 4 News started an investigation into Cambridge Analytica’s actions
relating to the 2016 US Presidential Election. Ethical and privacy issues were raised when
personal data was collected from sources including Facebook users without their consent.

- WannaCry, a piece of ransomware, targeted computers running Microsoft Windows in 2017. The ransomware had a significant global impact and affected NHS computer systems in England and Scotland.
